1. Create usable Bash scripts to compile  and execute Java programs (Bash scripts with executable flags)
    Place these into a new directory called
    bin/compile.sh
    bin/exec.sh

    The bin/compile.sh should not take any arguments and will just compile everything  under src
    The bin/exec.sh needs to take one argument that  is a fully qualified class name.

2. Improve an interactive Calculator program, that:

    a. Has a greeting

    d. Responds to bad input with humor (not offending).
