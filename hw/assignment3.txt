1. Create usable Bash scripts to compile  and execute Java programs (Bash scripts with executable flags)
    Place these into a new directory called
    bin/compile.sh
    bin/exec.sh

    The bin/compile.sh should not take any arguments and will just compile everything  under src
    The bin/exec.sh needs to take one argument that  is a fully qualified class name.

2. Write an interactive Calculator program, that:

    a. Prompts for an operation, such as: add, subtract, divide and multiply.
    b. Once the operation is selected, prompt for a first operand
    c. Prompt for a second operand
    d. Produce and print a result in this format:

         The result is:  23 + 3 = 26

    e. Ask if user wants more calculations.  If yes, go to step (a.) if not, quit and say "good bye".
    f. Store every operation in a form of a text file called "calculator.log" in the directory "classes", such  that the file would read:
        2 + 4 = 6
        2 * 2 = 4
        ...
