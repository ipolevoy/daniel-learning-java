## Data Structures

# Array

Fixed size number of slots  for things.

# List

Similar to arrays, but can grow. Growth comes at a cost. It maintains  an internal array 
and reallocates a bigger array when it needs to "grow". 


# Set

It is a bag of things. See [SetExample](SetExample.java). 

## Hash

What is a hash?

__A hash is a string of bytes produced from some input.__ 

Properties of a hash:

* Different inputs will produce different hashes
